                I founded the project <em>Editions of You</em> to celebrate and
                showcase self-publishing and self-releasing musicians and the
                handmade editions and releases they create. Core activities
                include curating and housing a physical archive of handmade
                releases and zines, and supporting independent artists and small
                labels by running a not-for-profit distro. A core establishing
                event for the project was the 2011 festival, funded by ACE, and
                organised in collaboration with the O3 Gallery and Oxford
                Contemporary Music, that included a gallery exhibition, gig and
                talk series, and zine fair. Core activities, particularly
                distro, 2011-2019.
