              Lisa Busby is a Scottish composer, vocalist, and improviser based
              in London [until 2020]. Situated across experimental music,
              performance art, and pop song, her practice often utilises the
              found and the prosaic, and manifests in various entangled modes –
              long-duration and site specific work, video, non-standard
              scoring/notation, “anti-production” techniques for electronic
              music, and live improvisation for sound/body. Lisa is one of

              Materially her work has explored in fragments, fringes and
              collisions of song and noise; artefacts of pop and fan culture,
              histories and archives; experimental turntablism and expanded
              usage of playback, samples and loops; and everyday action as/in
              performative gesture. Instrumentally her specialisms are in voice,
              turntables, hardware and software electronics, with more recent
              work incorporating electric guitar and lapsteel. She performs and
              composes with band Rutger Hauser; is part of
